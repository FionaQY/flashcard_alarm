# 🕰️ Flashcard Alarm App

This is a unique alarm clock app with a twist — to turn off the alarm, you must correctly recall a few **words of your chosen language**! It's like a flashcard quiz integrated into your morning routine. You can also use the app any time just to **practice your vocabulary**.

## 🚀 Features

- ⏰ **Set Custom Alarms**: Choose your wake-up time.
- 🧠 **Vocabulary Challenge to Dismiss**: The alarm won’t stop until you finished a challenge of your own choosing.
- 📚 **Flashcard Mode**: Practice your vocabulary anytime without setting an alarm.
- 🔔 **Repeat Alarms**, snooze options.

## 🎓 Why?

Learning a new language through repetition is powerful — and what better time to lock in new words than when you're waking up with a clear mind (and a strong incentive)? This app helps build strong recall habits through forced active recall.
